    "# Week 3: Silly goofy Visualizations + Outlier Extravaganza\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Week's Content\n",
    "This week, we will be taking it step by step and starting with some visualizations via Plotly and Matplotlib to explore the dataset (think of it like an extended EDA) a little more and get a grasp on what the data looks like from a few perspectives. I thought this was a fun one because there are so many ways data scientists can view a dataset with the literal bajillions of options to visualize something these days. Let's explore a few of them : )\n",
    "\n",
    "So the way this week will work will be that I will *attempt* to teach what each visualization is, why it may be important, ask a short coding and qualitative question, and then provide a demo for you guys!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Libraries\n",
    "[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. It is one of the most common libraries used in data analysis and we will primarily be using the pandas DataFrame to manipulate our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[numpy](https://numpy.org/): the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Many of the matplotlib functions are built into pandas DataFrames, so we will likely not have to call them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "[plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts."
