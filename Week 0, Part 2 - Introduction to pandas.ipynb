    "Okay, so I was going to make a cute lil' pandas tutorial until I found this beautiful tutorial created by our very own D-Lab at Berkeley! This is completely repurposed material and it works pretty well at getting you accustomed to the type of functions we will work with. I have also included the solutions because this is not meant to be a time intensive experience, it's meant for you to learn pandas in a pleasant manner. If you get stuck, go ahead and check out the solutions and make sure you understand them. : )\n",

    "This workshop's goal&mdash;which is facilitated by this Jupyter notebook&mdash;is to give attendees the confidence to use `pandas` in their research projects. Basic familiarity with Python *is* assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` is designed to make it easier to work with structured data. Most of the analyses you might perform will likely involve using tabular data, e.g., from .csv files or relational databases (e.g., SQL). The `DataFrame` object in `pandas` is \"a two-dimensional tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The `pandas` name itself is derived from *panel data*, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured data sets, and *Python data analysis* itself. After getting introduced, you can consult the full [`pandas` documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate this workshop, we'll work with example data and go through the various steps you might need to prepare data for analysis. You'll (hopefully) realize that doing this type of work is much more difficult using Python's built-in data structures."

    "\n",
    "The best way to get a sense of this data is to **plot it.** Next, we'll start to look at some basic plotting with `pandas`. Before we begin, let's sort the data by country and date. This is good practice and is especially important when using `pandas`'s `.plot()` method because the x-axis values are based on the indices. When we sort, the index values remain unchanged. Thus, we need to reset them. The `drop` parameter tells `pandas` to construct a `DataFrame` *without* adding a column."
